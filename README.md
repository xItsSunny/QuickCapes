# **QuickCapes**
**This mod is mainly a result of the hard work of Aycy, so this was only possible thanks to him.**
## Features:
This Mod allows it user to select and display every currently available cape that was leaked or is already out. This applies to capes that can be seen here:
- [Minecon Capes](https://minecraftcapes.net/gallery/minecon-capes)
- [Java Capes](https://minecraftcapes.net/gallery/java-capes) 
  
All of those capes can be selected with a very simple gui.

## 
This mod is mainly a result of the hard work of Aycy, so this was only possible thanks to him. Sadly he quit the developement of his mods a while ago, so I wasn't able to ask him directly for permission. So if someone who isnt fine with the existance of this mod sees that, please contact my on discord under the username ".xitssunny"!
